# FORTRAN_exercises
## Hi~ I'm Li Dongxu
This repository is used to store the exercises of FORTRAN programming class in 2018 spring semester.
</br>
<br/>
The source codes are in the form of FORTRAN 95. They have been compiled and tested using Intel FORTRAN Compiler under Linux.
If you want to run the codes, you had better re-compile them on your machine.
</br>
<br/>
Each directory contains an exercise (the source codes and documentation). At the beginning of the semester, the exercises are 
usually simple. If you want to see the more complex ones, go to the directories with the larger numbers such as 7 or larger.
</br>
<br/>
You can feel free using the codes without my permission. If there is anything to discuss, please E-mail me at wdbbygxjdsmyp@163.com

### Thank you! 谢谢！
